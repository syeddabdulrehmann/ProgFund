Programming Fundamentals – Lab Repository 🚀

Welcome to my Programming Fundamentals (PF) Lab Repository! This repository contains all my lab work, assignments, and projects from my BS Software Engineering course. Each program is written in C++, following the core concepts of programming and problem-solving.

📌 About This Repository

This repository is designed to document my journey through Programming Fundamentals. It includes a variety of C++ programs covering essential programming concepts such as:

✅ Basic Syntax & I/O – Understanding cin, cout, escape sequences
✅ Variables, Constants & Data Types – Storing and manipulating data efficiently
✅ Operators & Expressions – Arithmetic, relational, logical, and bitwise operations
✅ Decision Control Structures – Implementing if-else, nested if, and switch statements
✅ Loops & Iteration – Using for, while, and do-while loops for automation
✅ Arrays & Strings – Managing data efficiently using single and multidimensional arrays
✅ Functions & Recursion – Writing modular and reusable code
✅ Pointers & Dynamic Memory – Understanding memory management and efficient programming techniques
✅ File Handling – Reading from and writing to files using C++

This repository is continuously updated with new lab exercises and projects as I progress through my course.
